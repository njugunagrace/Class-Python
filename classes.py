 # the djembe is known for its wide range of tones, and the bougarabou is noted for its deep rich bass tones. you want to create a sofware application model of the drum circle that encapsulates these different types of drums.
 # you wish to include methods for each drum that represent the sound it makes, and also group similar drums together. think about creating a base drum class that contains properties and methods common to all drums and then
 # create subclasses for each specific type of drum (like Djembe,talkingDrum and baogarabou). the subclasses should inherit from the base drum class and also implement their unique characteristics. this software model would help newcomers understand the characteristics of each drum and how they conribute to the overall rhythm of the drum cicle
